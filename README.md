# TicTacToe - Application Requirements
The application is expecting the user(s) to enter their name(s) and play a classic Tic Tac Toe game by pressing the nine buttons displayed. The first to start and press one of the buttons will always be X and the other one O. Depending on who gets a winning combination first, a message letting them know they won will apppear. If no one wins, a draw message will appear. Hitting  "NEW GAME”  will reset all the buttons.

The results to be displayed:

-Name (X)/(O) Wins! – If one of the players has a winning combination ( Three X’s or O’s  on a row, column or diagonal).

-Draw – If no one has a winning combination and all the buttons are pressed.

-Warning: " Enter your name/names" – If no one enters their name.
